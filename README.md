This repository is used to store Dicoding - Beginner Machine Learning Final Project.

The flow of work is as below : 
1. Do clustering for dataset that has no label, process it so that we create a new file to be used for classification, as clustering's output is clustered data that can be represented numerically.
2. Do classification for dataset from clustering.

student_depression.csv is the dataset used for clustering.
clustered_data is the output of clustering, and the dataset used for classification.
